## What I built

I built a whatsapp chatbot which gives the information about the current covid status around the world and India and also the specific stats about the states in the India. 

In order to make it more interesting , I made use of the geolocation api help from google maps to get hospitals from the user's location with radius of 1.5 kms.


### How I built it 

I made use of the twilio's whatsapp api to create a bot with python's flask framework as backend.
