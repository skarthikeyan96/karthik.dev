## Background
(What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?)

I mainly wanted to try out python and mongodb.

###  Did you learn something new along the way? Pick up a new skill?

1. Learned how to create API endpoints with mongodb and FastAPI.
2. Understood the JWT auth flow and built the endpoints.


## What's next

1. Allowing the user to add multimedia text in their journal
2. Encrypting the journal content.
3. Notion integration.
