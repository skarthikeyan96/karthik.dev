---

The UI is  built using React components that are styled using Tailwind classes. These components  include a navigation bar, a main content area, and various charts and graphs displaying data.

The charts and graphs are be built using Recharts components. These components include a line chart displaying sales data over time, a bar chart showing customer demographics, and a pie chart showing product sales by category.

The UI would be designed to be responsive, so that it can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
